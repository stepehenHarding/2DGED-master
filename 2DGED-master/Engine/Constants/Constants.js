/**
 * Defines whether a Sprite is Drawn and/or Updated by the ObjectManager Draw and Update methods
 *
 * Usage:
 * 
 * A Sprite that is Drawn and Updated (i.e. visible on screen and needing to have its
 * controllers updated) will have statusType set to StatusType.Drawn | Status.Updated 
 * which, when we perform a bitwise OR gives us the following:
 * 
 *    0001
 *    0010
 *    ----
 *  | 0011 (3)
 * 
 * When we want to check if this Sprite should be Drawn or Updated then we perform a bitwise AND
 * with the Sprites' statusType and the field we want to check. For example the statusType below (0011)
 * when AND'ed with the value for Updated (0010) gives a NON-ZERO value, which indicates that the
 * Updated field was set.
 * 
 *    0011
 *    0010
 *    ----
 *  & 0010 (2) != 0 => this value contains/has Updated set
 * 
 * It's important that each value (e.g. Drawn, Updated) is a power of 2 value (e.g. 2^1, 2^2),
 * otherwise the bitwise operations (AND, OR) would not work correctly.
